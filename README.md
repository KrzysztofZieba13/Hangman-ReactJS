# Hangman-ReactJS

Classic hangman game, build using React.
Project was created to practice using React hooks.
Data is saved in localStorage. This App doesn't use any APIs for getting secrets, due to it's Polish version. If App were written in English, then secrets would be from API. That's no problem.

## Hooks in project

Hooks that were used in project: useState, useEffect, useRef and CUSTOM HOOKS
